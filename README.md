# Homework 4

in this assignment we were told to build a javascript quiz. 
-----------------------------------------------------------
the quiz should have the following:
1. a timer that affects the outcome
2. a way to submit scores to the local machine
3. when an answer is selected, the quiz moves on
4. when an incorrect answer is selected time is removed from the clock
5. there is a start button to start the quiz

I made a lot of progress making this quiz happen. I spent a lot of time googling the issues I was having.
some of the biggest issues were the local files. 
reading and writing from them without burning my data was hard.

I had trouble getting the out-of-time condition to fire like it is supposed to.

I also had trouble getting the quiz to not throw an error when reaching the last question. I check and double checked but everything looked correct.
